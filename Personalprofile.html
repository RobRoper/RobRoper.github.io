				<u> <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">Learning Style Test Results:</a></u>
				<br>
				<br>Auditory: 35%
				<br>Visual: 25%
				<br>Tactile: 40%
				<br>
				<br>Result = Tactile:
				<br>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things
				through physical movement.
				<br>You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend
				to learn better when some
				<br>type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often
				speak with your hands and with
				<br>gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.
				<br>
				<br><u>The Big 5 Personality Test Results:</u>
				<br>
				<br>Openness: 60%
				<br>Conscientiousness: 69%
				<br>Extraversion: 44%
				<br>Agreeableness: 50%
				<br>Neuroticism: 54%
				<br>
				<br>Personality Patterns:
				<br>Empathic Idealist: Uses insight a creativity to help others. Thinks about how the world could be a
				better and more beautiful place.
				<br>Analytical Thinker: Solves logical problems with rational, complex analysis. Thinks about innovative
				ways to improve systems.
				<br>
				<br>What my results mean for me:
				<br>In my opinion the results I got from these three tests are showing good indicators for someone who
				works in the IT industry.
				<br>The Myers-Briggs test and the Big 5 test both mention analytical problem solving in the results.
				This will definitely help me in my
				<br>career in IT as problem solving skills are crucial in roles such as programming, software
				development etc for debugging and resolving
				<br>issues when they appear. My learning style indicates that I learn by doing not just by reading
				seeing or hearing which will help me when
				<br>trying to figure out a problem on my own. It makes sense that introverted had been mentioned in the
				results as I do enjoy my own time and
				<br>like working on things on my own.
				<br>
				<br>How these results will influence my behaviour in a team:
				<br>In a team environment my results will mean that I am happy to work with others to achieve a desired
				goal however I do value my own opinion
				<br>and like to learn things in my own way. Organization and strategy will be good tools to help me when
				working as part of a team.
				<br>
				<br>What I need to take into account when forming a team:
				<br>My results show that I am introverted so I think I will need to remember to speak up when in a team
				environment and voice my own opinion.
				<br>As I don’t enjoy being around large groups of people I think that a smaller, tight knit team of
				people would suit me more than a larger team.
				<br>I would work better with like minded people so being in a team with other introverts and thinkers
				would have the best results.
