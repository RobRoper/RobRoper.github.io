<br>Result=Tactile
<br>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. 
<br>You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some 
<br>type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with 
<br>gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.
