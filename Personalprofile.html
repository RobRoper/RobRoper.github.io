<br>
<br>Result = Tactile:
<br>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You understand and remember things through physical movement. 
<br>You are a "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you learn, and you tend to learn better when some 
<br>type of physical activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks, you often speak with your hands and with 
<br>gestures, and you may have difficulty sitting still.

<br>What my results mean for me:
<br>In my opinion the results I got from these three tests are showing good indicators for someone who works in the IT industry. 
<br>The Myers-Briggs test and the Big 5 test both mention analytical problem solving in the results. This will definitely help me in my 
<br>career in IT as problem solving skills are crucial in roles such as programming, software development etc for debugging and resolving 
<br>issues when they appear. My learning style indicates that I learn by doing not just by reading seeing or hearing which will help me when 
<br>trying to figure out a problem on my own. It makes sense that introverted had been mentioned in the results as I do enjoy my own time and 
<br>like working on things on my own. 
<br>
<br>How these results will influence my behaviour in a team:
<br>In a team environment my results will mean that I am happy to work with others to achieve a desired goal however I do value my own opinion 
<br>and like to learn things in my own way. Organization and strategy will be good tools to help me when working as part of a team. 
<br>
<br>What I need to take into account when forming a team:
<br>My results show that I am introverted so I think I will need to remember to speak up when in a team environment and voice my own opinion. 
<br>As I don’t enjoy being around large groups of people I think that a smaller, tight knit team of people would suit me more than a larger team. 
<br>I would work better with like minded people so being in a team with other introverts and thinkers would have the best results.
