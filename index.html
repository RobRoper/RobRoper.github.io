                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <br>I was born in Ballarat Victoria on the 12th of March 1990. I grew up there and attended Ballarat and
                Clarendon
                College where I completed year 12 in 2007.
                <br>From then till now I have worked in a diverse range of jobs, from machine operating, working in bars
                and clubs
                and as a prison officer.
                <br>I then moved to Melbourne in 2019 to live with my partner Siobhan. We now live in Brunswick West
                with our little
                Border Terrier puppy, Scout.
                <br> I am currently working as an Operations Manager for an equipment hire company and have recently
                started
                studying Information Technology online at RMIT.
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>Interest in IT:</h3>
                <br>My interest in IT started a young age playing video games and using a laptop all through my
                education. I always
                wondered and enjoyed contemplating how the
                <br>technology worked and knew that I wanted to study it in depth one day. My interest was sparked
                through my
                passion for video games but a more specific moment
                <br>was in an audio editing class at school. I remember the teacher at the time showed us how to use
                command prompt
                to remotely access another students computer
                <br>on the same network. The idea of this being possible amazed me and made me think of what else could
                be possible
                using technology. I have always been good with
                <br>technology and picked things up very fast when using new mobile phones, computers or new software. I
                have done
                some self taught html coding using Google in the
                <br>past and this triggered me to want to learn more and enroll in a university course that would be
                recognized so
                that I can one day pursue a career in IT.
                <br>
                <br>I chose to do my study through RMIT as it is well known for its excellent technology related
                courses. When
                looking at course structures the RMIT version of the
                <br>Bachelor of Information Technology had the most subjects that sounded appealing to me.
                <br>
                <br>During my study I expect to learn a bit of everything about the IT world so that I can then launch a
                career in
                my desired direction. I expect to come out of this
                <br>course knowing how to apply critical analysis, solve ICT problems, communicate effectively in the IT
                world, work
                as a valuable team member and make informed decisions
                <br>in a professional environment. At the moment I am still unsure what specific area I would like to
                pursue but I
                do know that coding, security, game development and robotics interests me the most.
