<br> <h2>About Me:</h2> 
<br>I was born in Ballarat Victoria on the 12th of March 1990. I grew up there and attended Ballarat and Clarendon College where I completed year 12 in 2007.
<br>From then till now I have worked in a diverse range of jobs, from machine operating, working in bars and clubs and as a prison officer. 
<br>I then moved to Melbourne in 2019 to live with my partner Siobhan. We now live in Brunswick West with our little Border Terrier puppy, Scout.
<br> I am currently working as an Operations Manager for an equipment hire company and have recently started studying Information Technology online at RMIT. 
<br>
<br>
<h3>Interest in IT:</h3>
<br>My interest in IT started a young age playing video games and using a laptop all through my education. I always wondered and enjoyed contemplating how the 
<br>technology worked and knew that I wanted to study it in depth one day. My interest was sparked through my passion for video games but a more specific moment 
<br>was in an audio editing class at school. I remember the teacher at the time showed us how to use command prompt to remotely access another students computer 
<br>on the same network. The idea of this being possible amazed me and made me think of what else could be possible using technology. I have always been good with 
<br>technology and picked things up very fast when using new mobile phones, computers or new software. I have done some self taught html coding using Google in the 
<br>past and this triggered me to want to learn more and enroll in a university course that would be recognized so that I can one day pursue a career in IT.
<br>
<br>I chose to do my study through RMIT as it is well known for its excellent technology related courses. When looking at course structures the RMIT version of the 
<br>Bachelor of Information Technology had the most subjects that sounded appealing to me.
<br>
<br>During my study I expect to learn a bit of everything about the IT world so that I can then launch a career in my desired direction. I expect to come out of this 
<br>course knowing how to apply critical analysis, solve ICT problems, communicate effectively in the IT world, work as a valuable team member and make informed decisions 
<br>in a professional environment. At the moment I am still unsure what specific area I would like to pursue but I do know that coding, security, game development and robotics interests me the most.
