    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <br>I was born in Ballarat Victoria on the 12th of March 1990. I grew up there and attended Ballarat and Clarendon
    College where I completed year 12 in 2007.
    <br>From then till now I have worked in a diverse range of jobs, from machine operating, working in bars and clubs
    and as a prison officer.
    <br>I then moved to Melbourne in 2019 to live with my partner Siobhan. We now live in Brunswick West with our little
    Border Terrier puppy, Scout.
    <br> I am currently working as an Operations Manager for an equipment hire company and have recently started
    studying Information Technology online at RMIT.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Interest in IT:</h3>
    <br>My interest in IT started a young age playing video games and using a laptop all through my education. I always
    wondered and enjoyed contemplating how the
    <br>technology worked and knew that I wanted to study it in depth one day. My interest was sparked through my
    passion for video games but a more specific moment
    <br>was in an audio editing class at school. I remember the teacher at the time showed us how to use command prompt
    to remotely access another students computer
    <br>on the same network. The idea of this being possible amazed me and made me think of what else could be possible
    using technology. I have always been good with
    <br>technology and picked things up very fast when using new mobile phones, computers or new software. I have done
    some self taught html coding using Google in the
    <br>past and this triggered me to want to learn more and enroll in a university course that would be recognized so
    that I can one day pursue a career in IT.
    <br>
    <br>I chose to do my study through RMIT as it is well known for its excellent technology related courses. When
    looking at course structures the RMIT version of the
    <br>Bachelor of Information Technology had the most subjects that sounded appealing to me.
    <br>
    <br>During my study I expect to learn a bit of everything about the IT world so that I can then launch a career in
    my desired direction. I expect to come out of this
    <br>course knowing how to apply critical analysis, solve ICT problems, communicate effectively in the IT world, work
    as a valuable team member and make informed decisions
    <br>in a professional environment. At the moment I am still unsure what specific area I would like to pursue but I
    do know that coding, security, game development and robotics interests me the most.
