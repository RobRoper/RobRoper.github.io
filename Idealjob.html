<b>Description:</b>
<br>My ideal job would be a game developer/programmer. In this role I would be using the C++ coding language to help develop any games that this company wins contracts for. 
<br>I would need to liaise with other team members and clients to find out how they want their game to play and make this come to life.
<br>
<br>
<b>Skills Required:</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>2 years experience coding in the C++ language</li>
	<li>Understanding and experience working in the game development industry</li>
	<li>Clear and efficient communication skills</li>
	<li>Advanced problem solving skills</li>
	<li>Ability to work alone and in a team</li>
	<li>Passion for gaming</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>Skills I currently have:</b>
<br>
<ul>
	<li>Ability to work alone and in a team</li>
	<li>Passion for gaming</li>
	<li>Good communication skills (but not specific to the IT industry)</li>
	<li>Problem solving skills</li>
	<li>Limited experience in Java coding</li>
	<li>Basic computer skills</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<b>Plan to gain the needed skills:</b>
<br>In order to be considered for the above role I will need to have completed my Bachelor Information Technology so that I have a higher chance of being employed. 
<br>Completing the course will help improve my current communication and problem solving skills so that they are at an IT industry level. After completing the course 
<br>I would need to first get into the game industry at a lower level to gain some experience. I would also need to either study a course purely on C++ language or gain 
<br>some experience with this language while working in the industry. After I have achieved these goals I think I would be a good candidate for the above role.
