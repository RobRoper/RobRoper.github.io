<h1> Project Idea 
<br> “The OCD Robot”</h1>
<p>
<b>Overview:</b>
<br>My project idea is to use a raspberry pi to build a small robot that can clean up clutter in peoples houses and place them all in a desired location. 
<br>The robot can be accessed and initiated via any mobile smart device to begin the cleanup process. The user will also be able to access the camera and movement 
<br>function of the robot manually to check on their pet/house while they are at work. The pricing for the “OCD Robot” is yet to be announced and is still in development.
<br>
<br><b>Motivation:</b>
<br>According to the National Healthy Homes Training Center and Network (NCHH.org), accidental falls account for 33 percent of all home injury deaths. 
<br>This includes tripping over clutter and other types of preventable accidents. 
<br>The OCD Robot will help to lower this percentage by cleaning up the clutter in peoples houses efficiently and with little to no effort from the residents. 
<br>The market for the OCD Robot is huge as anyone with children, dogs or cats will know how quickly toys and clutter can be scattered around the house on a daily basis. 
<br>Not only will the OCD Robot create a safer environment for people who are too busy or lazy to clean themselves but it will also be a tool for people to be able to check 
<br>on their homes or pets while they are not in the house. Using Raspberry PI technology is a cheap and easy solution to this problem. 
<br>
<br><b>Description:</b>
<br>The OCD Robot will be sold pre-programmed using the raspberry pi attached to the robot. This robot will be sturdy and strong to avoid any potential damaged caused by manual 
<br>control or by pets or children. The user will only need to set the desired “storage location” for all toys/clutter by pressing a button when the Robot is in position. 
<br>Once the user activates the “clean up” mode from the app on their smart device, the Robot will get to work. There are collision sensors on each side of the OCD Robot so that 
<br>it avoids running into objects or walls. The wheels are thick and rubber so that it can grip to any surface and prevent fast wear and tear. There is a camera mounted at the 
<br>front which can detect the size of objects and figure out if it is small enough to be picked up. The robotic arm mounted on the top of the device will then proceed to pick 
<br>the item up and drop it off at the storage location. Once the Robot has done several laps of the house and does not detect anymore small objects it will then return to the 
<br>storage location and power off. A picture of the objects in the storage location will then be taken and sent to the users mobile app so they can see that it has finished. 
<br>This will also be helpful if the Robot finds any items that you thought you had lost. The OCD Robot will park itself on the wireless charging pad that comes with it so its 
<br>charged and ready for use whenever there is mess to be eliminated.
<br>Another feature of the OCD Robot is that it can be controlled manually by the user if desired. This can be used for practical use or for a bit of entertainment. 
<br>Whether its getting cute snaps of what pets get up to while you are not home or checking that you have locked the door, many users will love this feature. 
<br>In the mobile app the user will select manual control and have access to the robots acceleration, steering and camera. They will then see a control pad on their phone and 
<br>the video from the camera will be streamed to the app so they can see where they are going. From any location they can then see what is going on in their house when they are 
<br>not home, and take pictures/play with lonely pets.
<br>
<br><b>Tools and Technologies:</b>
<br>For this project to come to life we will need the following hardware: a raspberry pi board, all cables required for wiring, a camera that can take video and pictures, a 
<br>battery (and case), the wireless charging dock, 4 sensors for sensing objects/walls, a robotic arm, a wifi receiver and a remote control board. It will also need the wheels, 
<br>axles, body and structural components. The software needed for this will be the raspbian operating system to load onto the PI, a programming IDE such as Java Eclipse 
<br>(or whichever language it will be programmed in), zoom meetings so the development team can communicate through production and an Android Studio for making the mobile app.  
<br>
<br><b>Skills Required:</b>
<br>The skills required by the IT specialists for the project will be having a strong programming knowledge, problem solving skills, building electrical systems, experience with 
<br>raspberry pi technology, teamwork, communication and good user centred design researching skills. The skills and hardware required for this project should be easily found using 
<br>a platform like seek to advertise for programmers/robotics IT specialists and the hardware can all be purchased online through raspberry pi and consumer electronic parts websites.
<br>
<br><b>Outcome:</b>
<br>If this project is successful I believe the outcome will be a marketable and profitable product that will sell well due to the high demand on time for busy people with clutter in 
<br>their homes. The original problem of general tidiness and the accidental falls in home will be reduced as peoples houses will be less cluttered when they return home and they will 
<br>have less risk of accidentally stepping on said clutter. The impact of this could be huge and result in less injury/death in peoples homes, not to mention the added entertainment 
<br>of spying on your pets while at work.
